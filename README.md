# 100 Days Of Code Journal / School of Code Bootcamp Journal

## Day 1

_Feb 26 2023_

### **Todays Progress:**

- 📚 I looked up info on markdown after looking at the brilliant diary kept by a former SOC student.

- 🖥️ I went back through my HTML and CSS code on the website I made and started adapting things to be more responsive.

- 📝 I'll have to go look up the command line info to connect to a new Repo I made so I can upload this Readme file but also so I can update this hopefully day by day.

### **Thoughts:**

💪 I'm lucky to have all these resources available, but I just hope I can use them to my full potential. I'm so happy to have been accepted into the School of Code. I want to do this 100 days of code challenge. It still feels daunting even if it's supposed to be an hour a day. Home life is about to change too with my youngest starting nursery. I will find the balance.

## Day 2

_Feb 27 2023_

### **Todays Progress:**

- 📚 I looked into creating a guide for myself for connecting to a repo again and then wrote it down in a word doc. As I had set up links for my previous repo but it had been a while still good to refresh on git inputs.

- 🖥️ I've more website stuff to check through before pushing to a branch before merging. I thought it better to keep my hand in with some Javascript work with codecademy today I had a go making classes that you use to make a new instance from. Here's a brief example:

```
class Surgeon {
constructor(name, department) {
this.name = name;
this.department = department;
}
}

const surgeonRomero = new Surgeon('Francisco Romero', 'Cardiovascular');

console.log(surgeonRomero);

const surgeonJackson = new Surgeon('Ruth Jackson', 'Orthopedics');

console.log(surgeonJackson);

Output was:

Output:
Surgeon { name: 'Francisco Romero', department: 'Cardiovascular' }
Surgeon { name: 'Ruth Jackson', department: 'Orthopedics' }
```

- 📝 I think I'll continue with more of this tomorrow I'd like to complete the intermediate JS stuff section as it's good to have a bit consistency before doing something else.

### **Thoughts:**

Today I felt a little daunted as I was trying to make sure I was consistent. Also had to make sure I'd done all that was required before starting SOC bootcamp. It's like a building anxiety and excitement. I really want to do well, I worry about things but then I continued reading all of the drop downs and when I found structure to the days that lay ahead I realised that everyone will be in the same boat. I can do this I just have to keep believing or maybe I need to listening to live to win 10 times and get pumped up. 🎶🔥
