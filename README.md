### **Todays Progress:**

<<<<<<< HEAD
- 📚 I looked up info on markdown after looking at the brilliant diary kept by a former SOC student.

- 🖥️ I went back through my HTML and CSS code on the website I made and started adapting things to be more responsive.

- 📝 I'll have to go look up the command line info to connect to a new Repo I made so I can upload this Readme file but also so I can update this hopefully day by day.

### **Thoughts:**

💪 I'm lucky to have all these resources available, but I just hope I can use them to my full potential. I'm so happy to have been accepted into the School of Code. I want to do this 100 days of code challenge. It still feels daunting even if it's supposed to be an hour a day. Home life is about to change too with my youngest starting nursery. I will find the balance.

### **Links/resources:**
